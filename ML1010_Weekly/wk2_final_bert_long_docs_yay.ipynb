took out two rather small loans last winter with the help of my wife s research online One with this lender and another We are having no problems with the other lender who is very easy to deal with This lender has nothing but frustrating policies They will not talk to my wife even with my permission In the beginning when my wife tried to call even after I got on the line to give permission they gave her a hard time and when I emailed the to tell them I want my wife to be able to speak on all matters they refused unless I completed some notarized papers that I have no time for The other lender has no problem speaking with my wife after I gave this permission over the phone once when we took the loan Upstart will not even let my wife call to make a payment All reps just
